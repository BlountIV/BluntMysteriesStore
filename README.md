#Motivation for this Mystery themed store
---

#####Just wanted to try something different, but not make it realistic. The store is considered fantasy and purely fiction. The store is not complete and fantasy items can be added at any time and is still a WIP.

#Blunt Mystery Item Store

#####The home page is basic for now with a simple title and link to a few mystery items which is displayed in my database. Honestly just wanted a fantasy type store with a mystery, so you don't know what items you're getting until you click on it. I did add a description of the items and the official name of them because I know for sure I'd forget what the names were called if i didn't.
